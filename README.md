# top-type-sizes

Nightly rustc provides the `print-type-sizes` option for printing sizes of all types. It's especially useful for analyzing why futures are soo big, that can hurt performance a lot if such futures are moved.

However, `print-type-sizes` produces unordered and cluttered output. This crate parses that output, refine it and show top types by size in compact form.

Features:
* Sorts types by size.
* Deduplicates same types.
* Merges variants with similar layout.
* Shows layouts in compact form.
* Sorts fields by size (`-s`).
* Hides small types and fields (`-h`).
* Hides wrappers like `MaybeUninit` and custom ones (`-w`).
* Filters by type names (`-f` and `-e`).
* Limits output (`-l`).
* Expands specific types with children, heuristically (`-p`).

## Usage
Firstly, install by using `cargo install top-type-sizes` or clone the repository and run `cargo build --release`.

Secondly, compile your project:
```sh
$ RUSTFLAGS=-Zprint-type-sizes cargo +nightly build -j 1 > type-sizes.txt
```
* It should be a fresh build without cache. Otherwise, part of info will be lost.
* `-Zprint-type-sizes` requires the nightly compiler.
* `-j 1` is required to avoid incorrect shuffled output.

Finally, use this crate:
```sh
$ top-type-sizes < type-sizes.txt | less
```

### Help
```sh
$ top-type-sizes --help
```

```text
top-type-sizes 0.1.5

USAGE:
    top-type-sizes [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --help               Prints help information
    -w, --remove-wrappers    Removes wrappers like `MaybeUninit`
    -r, --reverse            Prints top `limit` types in ascending order
    -s, --sort-fields        Sorts fields by size and removes paddings
    -V, --version            Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -e, --exclude <exclude>...     Excludes types that match these patterns
    -p, --expand <expand>...       Shows only types that match these patterns and their children, heuristically
    -f, --filter <filter>...       Shows only types that match these patterns
    -h, --hide-less <hide-less>    Hides types and fields with size less than this value [default: 0]
    -l, --limit <limit>            Shows only this number of top types [default: 100]
```

## Examples
For instance, let's analyze the [`tokio/chat`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/master/examples/chat.rs) example:
```sh
RUSTFLAGS=-Zprint-type-sizes cargo +nightly build --example chat -j 1 > chat.txt
```

Once the compiler's output is collected, you can perform multiple queries until results become representative.

Initially, find interesting entry functions:
```sh
top-type-sizes -f chat.rs < chat.txt | less
```

* `-f <pattern>` hides all types that doesn't match the provided pattern. Note, that `async fn` has a path in a type name.

```text
...
1032 [async fn body@examples/chat.rs:174:33: 243:2] align=8
...
```

Ok, it's the [`process`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/4ea632005d689f850e87a116b9e535a0015a7a0f/examples/chat.rs#L170) function, let's check it and children types.

```sh
top-type-sizes -w -s -h 33 -p body@examples/chat.rs:174:33 < chat.txt | less
```

* `-w` hides wrappers, e.g.
    ```text
    1032 std::mem::MaybeUninit<[async fn body@examples/chat.rs:174:33: 243:2]> align=8
       1032 variant MaybeUninit
           1032 value
    ```
* `-s` sorts fields by size and hides paddings.
* `-h <size>` hides all types and fields with size less than the provided size.
* `-p <pattern>` hides all types that aren't contained in `<patten>` types. Note that the compiler doesn't provide types of fields, so this parameter filters types recursively by field sizes and can leave a lot of irrelevant types for small sizes (because they are more frequent). But it's very useful anyway.

Output:
```text
1032 [async fn body@examples/chat.rs:174:33: 243:2] align=8
   1031 variant Suspend2
        472 __awaitee align=8

    567 variant Suspend1
        144 lines
         40 stream
    552 variant Unresumed, Returned, Panicked
         40 stream

472 [async fn body@examples/chat.rs:155:27: 166:6] align=8

        144 lines
        112 __awaitee
    464 variant Unresumed, Returned, Panicked
        144 lines align=8
...
```

Note: `__awaitee` means awaiting on an inner future.

Then, you can use `-f` and `-e` to refine output even more.
